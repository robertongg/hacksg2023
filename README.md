## Project Descriptions

This project is for hack Singapore 2023 by our team, which consists of:
- Keith Lee Mun Wei (tojablejinx@gmail.com)
- Lim Ning (limningis@gmail.com)
- Robert Ong (robertong907@gmail.com)
- Sophia Chen (sophiachenyh@gmail.com)

Our team works on Sustainability as our theme, to promote sustainable consumption. As there are some lack of information about what are the recyclable things in Singapore, we decided to build a web application to locate different types of recycle bins based on a location. These recycle bins include blue bins, e-waste, and cash for trash. In the future, we will implement the web application into a mobile application and add more recylcing facilities.

To develop this web application, we have used the following tools and technologies:
- Web Scripting Language (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery)
- Geocoding API
- Github
